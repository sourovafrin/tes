## Installation

Create a Discord app, make it a bot, and grab it's Token by following this [link](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

Make these channels (names can be changed in source code) along with your other channels:

- abuse-reports
- requests-log
- actions-log

Also make these roles (can be changed in `src/config.js`) for members:

- Admin
- Moderator
- Explorer
- Creator

Make required changes in `src/config.js` and in `.env.example` then rename it to `.env`. Don't for get to change `BOT_OWNER_ID` to your discord user ID. This will give you admin access to the bot. In production set environment variables with `PM2` or others.

Use `npm start` in development, `npm run build` to compile the source code with Babel, then run `npm run serve` in production.


## Roadmap

This project is in its infancy. I am planning to add more commands and improve existing ones specially to help moderators do their job easily.
